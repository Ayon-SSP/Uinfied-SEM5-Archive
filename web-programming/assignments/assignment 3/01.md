# Controls Statements in Java Script

There are two type of control statements

- conditional statements
- iterative statements

## Conditional statements

there are three type of constional statements `if`, `if-else` & `switch`

### if & if-else

if & `if-else` are used for logical execution of statements that what when a given conditon is true `if` and what do to when it won`t

```js
var x = 2;

if (x==2) {
    console.log("Everything is fine!");
}
else {
    console.log("System is doomed");
}
```

### Switch

switch is just like `if-else` but with multiple conditions. used when there are multiple constitions where we need to match the conetent of a variable to execute a step.

```js
var inp = window.promt("Enter your choice");

switch (inp) {
    case "1":
        console.log("You have chosen 1");
        break;
    case "2":
        console.log("You have chosen 2");
        break;
    case "3":
        console.log("You have chosen 3");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("You have chosen something else");
        break;
}
```

## iterative statements

Iterrative statements are basically loops which execute until it met the required condition.

### While

`while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.

```js
var cap = 10;

while (cap--) {
    console.log("T-minus " + cap);
}

console.log("Blastoff! ðŸš€ðŸ’¥");
```

### do-while

`do-while` loop is used to execute a block of code at least once even if the condition is false.

```js
var cap = 10;

do {
    console.log("T-minus " + cap);
} while (cap--);

```

### for

`for` loop is just like `while`  & `do-while` but way shorter to declare cause the initialisation, condition and increment are all in one line.

```js

for (var i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {
    console.log("T-minus " + i);
}

console.log("Blastoff! ðŸš€ðŸ’¥");
```
